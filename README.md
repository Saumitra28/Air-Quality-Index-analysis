#Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis of Indian Cities

Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of various cities across India. The analysis involves transforming raw data and visualizing key insights using Power BI. The report includes multiple visualizations to help stakeholders understand the air quality patterns across different regions and time periods.

Objectives
Data Transformation: Clean and preprocess the raw AQI data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Visualization: Use Power BI to create insightful visualizations that convey key findings effectively.

KPIs Implemented
Average CO Levels: Shows the average levels of Carbon Monoxide (CO) across cities.
Average NO Levels: Displays the average Nitric Oxide (NO) levels, contributing to overall air quality.
Average SO2 Levels: Highlights the average Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) levels, a significant pollutant.
Average PM2.5 Levels: Illustrates the average levels of particulate matter (PM2.5), which is crucial in determining AQI.
Top 5 Most Polluted Cities: Stacked bar graph showing the cities with the highest pollution levels.
Top 5 Least Polluted Cities: Stacked bar graph showing the cities with the lowest pollution levels.
AQI Trend Line Graph: A line graph representing the AQI trends over time across different cities.
National AQI Map: A comprehensive map of India with bubble sizes representing AQI levels by city, providing a clear area-wise overview.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: The Power BI report includes interactive features that allow users to filter and explore the data according to their needs.
Data-driven Insights: The visualizations are designed to highlight critical air quality metrics, making it easier for decision-makers to identify areas of concern.
